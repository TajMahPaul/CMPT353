1. When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice? 

Answer:
    I definetly got a better result from Kalman filter. It seemed to detect the spikes better as the lowess filter was too smoothed. I also prefered the amount of parameter 
    I could play with in regards to the Kalman filter.

2. In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude?

Answer:
    Well in theory if we had some prior knowlegde about wiether these parameters were related, we could edit the values of the transition co-variance matrix to relect those relations in values other than
    the values in the middle. Or, like the last excercise on CPU tempts, if we knew something about the relations between the parameter, we could build a linear combination of values to calculate the next step 
    of parameters given the previous parameters.
