1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read? 
ANSWER:
    Pandas was definitely easier to work with since I have worked with it before. The one liners that are possible with aggregation functions make the readability and maintainability of code easier.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
ANSWER:
    %timeit pivot_months_pandas(data) : 32 ms ± 591 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    %timeit pivot_months_loops(data)  : 973 ms ± 5.81 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

    Difference:
        The difference in the timing comes from using a dedicated library to do calculation vs. manually doing it. A dedicated library that has been tried and tested with multiple people working it will always outperform an implementation you did yourself.
