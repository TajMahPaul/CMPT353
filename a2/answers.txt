1. The result is in the form y = mx + b. Where m is the slope, x is the data['timestamp'], b is the intercept.
This formula will produce a float value y which is the prediction of what the rating is. As you can see from the
data, the prediction values are close to the actual rating values. The prediction values are stored in 
data['prediction'].

2. This produces a best fit line because the formula is using the slope and intercept values found from
linear regression of the data['timestamp'] and data['rating']. The created_at values and timestamp values 
pair correctly to make points on the plot because timestamp is essentially created from created_at.
Timestamp is the number of seconds after some epoch based on the string date from created_at. 
Additionally, the rating for each timestamp value correponds to a point on the graph.
