1) Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why? Do you have any theory about why RGB/LAB/HSV worked better for different models?
    - For me it looked like the KNN model performed the best for the task. I think for this task that makes sense because colors that are close to a object being classified look visually similar. 
    Meaning Colors that are close in RGB, HSV, or any other colors values look similiar, so it makes sense to use a distance based approach. I think LAB values worked better since they normalize
    the color values a bit. The wikipedia articale says: "Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically."

2) 
    - I think that this algorithm makes reasonable mistakes, yes. The mistakes that are made are those where cities are really close in geographical location. This is reasonable because, generally, 
    cities that are close, share similar weather patterns. To add to the features? I could think of potentially adding a humidity index. Or, something like uv index. Something that would allow to differentiate
    cities that close to eachother. Not sure if those suggestions are valid, however.
